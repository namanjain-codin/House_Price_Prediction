# House_Price_Prediction
This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model training with multiple regression algorithms, evaluation, and visualization â€” all implemented in Python using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Project Overview
Goal: Predict house prices based on features like crime rate, number of rooms, tax rate, etc.

Dataset: Boston Housing Dataset (built-in with Scikit-learn).

Techniques: Data cleaning, feature scaling, encoding, model training, and evaluation.

Models Used:

Linear Regression

Lasso Regression

Ridge Regression
