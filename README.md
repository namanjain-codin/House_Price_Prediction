# House_Price_Prediction
This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to predict house prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model training with multiple regression algorithms, evaluation, and visualization — all implemented in Python using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

# Project Overview
Goal: Predict house prices based on features like crime rate, number of rooms, tax rate, etc.

Dataset: Boston Housing Dataset (built-in with Scikit-learn).

Techniques: Data cleaning, feature scaling, encoding, model training, and evaluation.

Models Used:

Linear Regression

Lasso Regression

Ridge Regression

# Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

# How It Works
1️⃣ Load the Dataset: Import the Boston Housing data and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values (if any).

Perform feature scaling and encoding as needed.

Visualize feature distributions and relationships.

3️⃣ Model Building:

Split data into training and testing sets.

Train Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regression models.

4️⃣ Evaluation:

Predict house prices on test data.

Evaluate performance using R² score and RMSE.

Compare results across models.

5️⃣ Visualization:

Plot predictions vs actual prices.

Visualize feature importance (if applicable).
